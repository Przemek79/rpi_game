Marshmallow Game Engine
=======================

**“The only game engine that tastes better slightly burned!”**

How to contribute
-----------------

It's very important to first fire up your favorite IRC client and point it to
[*#marshmallow_h @ freenode*][webirc], then simply describe what you want to
work on. The engine is still currently in a state of flux, so contributors must
be willing to accommodate changes.

The above also applies for non-code contributions (like documentation and such),
if you're interested in brainstorming new ideas, well, that's always welcome!

Coding standard
---------------

The coding standard is still a work in progress, I'm currently working on
normalizing the codebase. So you're best bet is to checkout recent commits, I
usually normalize files I work on.

I'll write up a proper document once I settle on the style, but for now, reading
the [FreeBSD style guidelines][style9] will give you and idea of how I write
code (albeit with a few OOP tweaks)
